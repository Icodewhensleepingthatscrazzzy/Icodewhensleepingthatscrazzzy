- - Greetings, I go by the name of @Vincent. 
- I have a keen interest in Python, Web Development, Java, C, C++, Graphics, and Robotics, among other things. 
- At the moment, I am fully immersed in expanding my knowledge of Java. 
- I am enthusiastic about the prospect of collaborating on projects involving Websites, Applications, and Game Development. 
- Feel free to reach out to me at @thirizller on Discord. 
My hobbies include gaming, coding, and various other activities.
I charge $1 for every project I work on, and rest assured, I am committed to delivering quality work and will not engage in any form of scamming. 
Please understand I wont be free 24/7 as some family and schools problems.
Thank you for your time, and I am looking forward to the opportunity to connect with you soon!
